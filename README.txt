Computer Vision:

Introduction to basic concepts in computer vision. Low level image analysis, image formation, edge detection, segmentation. Image transformations for image synthesis methods for 3D scene reconstruction, motion analysis, object recognition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Homework 1: Gaussian Filter, Median Filter, Separable filters - combining two 1D Gaussian filters, Difference of Gaussians, Histogram equalization - Essentially, a CDF is created from the histogram and mapped to a [0,255] value, and Low/high pass filters and image sharpening.

Homework 2: Match transformed images using SIFT features, Scene stitching with SIFT features and Object Recognition with HOG features.

Homework 3: Estimate Depth with Stereo, Image Classification with Bag of SIFT Representation + SVM Classifer - Bag of SIFT Representation and one-vs-all SVMs.

Homework 4: 
Training a Network From Scratch
- Try to boost the accuracy through Data Augmentation, Data Normalization, and Network Regularization.
- Try three different techniques taught in the class to increase the accuracy of your model. The minimum accuracy required for this section is 0.60.

Fine Tuning a Pre-Trained Deep Network
- Fine-tune an existing network (AlexNet). 
- Use the activations of the pre-trained AlexNet as features to train one-vs-all SVMs for your scene classification task.
- Fine-tune the ResNet network and compare performance with AlexNet.

Homework 5:
