Computer Vision:

Introduction to basic concepts in computer vision. Low level image analysis, image formation, edge detection, segmentation. Image transformations for image synthesis methods for 3D scene reconstruction, motion analysis, object recognition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Homework 1: Gaussian Filter, Median Filter, Separable filters - combining two 1D Gaussian filters, Difference of Gaussians, Histogram equalization - Essentially, a CDF is created from the histogram and mapped to a [0,255] value, and Low/high pass filters and image sharpening.

Homework 2: Match transformed images using SIFT features, Scene stitching with SIFT features and Object Recognition with HOG features.

Homework 3: Estimate Depth with Stereo, Image Classification with Bag of SIFT Representation + SVM Classifer - Bag of SIFT Representation and one-vs-all SVMs.

Homework 4:

Homework 5:
