There are 5 basic image processing problems.

1.

a. Gaussian Filter

b. Median Filter


2. Separable filters - combining two 1D Gaussian filters.


3. Difference of Gaussians


4. Histogram equalization - Essentially, a CDF is created from the histogram and mapped to a [0,255] value.


5. Low/high pass filters and image sharpening
