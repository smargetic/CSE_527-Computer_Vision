Homework 4:

Problem 1: Training a Network From Scratch

Problem 1.1: Try to boost the accuracy through Data Augmentation, Data Normalization, and Network Regularization.

Problem 1.2: Try three different techniques taught in the class to increase the accuracy of your model. The minimum accuracy required for this section is 0.60.


Problem 2: Fine Tuning a Pre-Trained Deep Network

Problem 2.1: Fine-tune an existing network (AlexNet). 

Problem 2.2: Use the activations of the pre-trained AlexNet as features to train one-vs-all SVMs for your scene classification task.

Problem 2.3:  Fine-tune the ResNet network and compare performance with AlexNet.
